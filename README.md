## :innocent: Motivation
It's decades since we are using devices such as computers and laptops, browsing internet, typing and scrolling through pages. What if we get to know how much we have scrolled through pages per session and so? In this small project I have implemented a scroll meter which just tells how much meter you have scrolled through. This is just a prototype!*
